GOAL
`Create an online NiceGUI todo app that looks like my "Urgent Perso" Airtable todo view.

STEPS
1. Create a gui file
   1.‚úÖ A "todo page"
   2. An "create todo" window
   3. A concatenated view all todos
2. Create functions and cli connected to gui (add, remove, edit)
3. Create an online database to store the todos and their properties (priority, source, etc)
4. Put it online

FEATURES
- All todos with buttons to filter on top
- Popup window to create a new todo
- Properties :
  - priority
  - source
  - fire or clock
  - deadline
  - status
  - files
  - comments
  - created time
  - modified timex


GEMINI PLAN
Yes, your plan is realistic and a great way to structure your first major project. You've correctly identified the main components: the user interface (GUI), the application logic (functions), and data storage (database).

However, you've missed a few crucial steps that are essential for managing your project and ensuring it works reliably. Here‚Äôs a refined version of your plan with some key additions.

1. Project Setup and Version Control (The Missing First Step)
Before writing any code, it's vital to set up your project environment properly.

Version Control (Git): This is non-negotiable, even for a solo project. Git allows you to save "snapshots" of your code, so you can easily revert to a previous version if you break something. It's like having unlimited undo for your entire project.

Action: Create a repository on GitHub or GitLab.

Dependency Management: You've already encountered this! Keep a requirements.txt file to list all the Python packages your project needs (like nicegui).

Action: Create the file and add nicegui. Update it whenever you add a new library.

2. Refined Development Plan
Your plan is good, but thinking about it in slightly different layers can make it easier to manage.

Phase 1: Local-First Development –ª–æ–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π

GUI (gui.py): Start here, just as you planned. Use dummy data at first (e.g., a simple Python list of dictionaries) to build your UI components without worrying about the database. Focus on making the "view," "create," and "details" cards functional. Your idea to replicate an Airtable-like view is ambitious but a great learning goal; start with a simpler table or list first, then enhance it.

Logic (functions.py): Create your functions (add_todo, remove_todo, etc.). Initially, these functions will simply modify your dummy data list. This step is crucial for separating your UI from your business logic, which makes the code much easier to manage.

Local Database: Before going online, make your app work with a simple local database. An SQLite database is perfect for this. It‚Äôs a single file on your computer and is supported by Python out of the box (via the sqlite3 module). This lets you figure out all the database logic without the complexity of online connections.

Phase 2: Going Online üåê

Online Database: Once your app works perfectly locally, swap out the SQLite connection for an online one. You could use services like Neon (for PostgreSQL), Supabase, or Firebase. This change should mostly affect your database connection code, not the rest of your app logic.

Deployment: This is your final "Put it online" step. You'll need a platform to host your NiceGUI application. Services like Hugging Face Spaces, PythonAnywhere, or Render are great starting points for Python web apps.

3. What Else to Keep in Mind
Error Handling: What happens if a user tries to add a to-do with no title? Or if the database connection fails? Plan for these scenarios by adding try...except blocks in your code to handle errors gracefully.

User Authentication (Optional): Right now, your app is for a single user. If you wanted different people to have their own private to-do lists, you would need to add a login system. This is an advanced topic, so consider it a "version 2" feature after you get the core app working.
